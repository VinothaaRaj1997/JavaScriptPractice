To run the JS program â€”  node name.js (eg. node basics.js)

In JavaScript variables are very loosely typed 
We can hold values with any type of data   

Redeclaring:    var c = 10       redeclaring is possible in var
                var c = 20       redeclaring not allowed in let
                                 redeclaring not allowed in const
                                               

Reassigning:    var a = 5       let b = 2      reassigning is also possible in var
                    a = 8           b = 3      reassigning  is possible in let
                                               Reassigning is not possible in const 

const - the value we assign will be constant in our entire script duration.

# while loop:
-------------
if the expression is true this loop will keep on executing until this condition whatever we wrote inside this become false. 
if this condition never become false, then the will go infinite times. (kill the terminal then it will gone).
it can take any kind of expression as condition.
we can't assign how many times the loop has to run.
it will break only when the condition is false.
we can run any statement also, bz while loop only looks if the condition is true, it can be anything.


# do while loop:
----------------
one round of loop will run before it checks the condition
no matter if the condition is true or false one round of loop will defenitely run. then only it checks the condition.  


# for loop:
-----------
use for loop, when you know that how many times you have to run this loop
